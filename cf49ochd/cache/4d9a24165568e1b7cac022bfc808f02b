Java Program to Check the Accessibility of an Static Variable By a Static Method . It&#x27;s value would remain the same throughout and one can not change its value again. Memory for the static variable is allocated at the time of class loading. If the final variable is a reference, this means that the variable cannot be re-bound to reference another object, but internal state of . In Java, final is the access modifier which can be used with a filed class and a method. I recommend my courses to freshers to get exposure to building real-time projects in the IT industry.

So, public final int mGoKart = MAX; is fine (but not the solution), but assigning to mGoKart later isn&#x27;t allowed. Example.

In case a final field is initialized to a compile-time constant in the field declaration, changes to the final field may not be visible, since uses of that final field are replaced at compile time with the compile-time constant. That&#x27;s the final that is causing the problem as you are later trying to assign to that variable in your load method where you set mGoKart = MAX.You can&#x27;t assign to a final variable except on the same line you declare it.. 2) final method. We refer to these lambdas as capturing lambdas.They can capture static variables, instance variables, and local variables, but only local variables must be final or effectively final.. Static variables stored in static memory . So when you assign a value to it, it does not change the value of the variable in the interface. For example, following program works fine.
